## Book Analysis

My attention was drawn to this project while I was reading *The
protrait of an artist as a young man* by James Joyes. Beside the style
of the text, the number of new words is an important
factor that makes a text hard to follow. That encourages me
to perform some basic analysis and compare the results for few
well-known authors such as Jame Joyce, Jane Austin, Bram Stoker and
english translation of works by Friedrich Nietzche.

Fortunately, the texts can be collected from [Gutenberg
project]{https://www.gutenberg.org}. Frist I performed a simple
analysis and build a dictionary of new words and number of occurance
of each words in the text. Here are some results for Jane Austin and
James Joyce.

| Jane Austin    |  New Words  | Total Words
|----------------|-------------|------------
| Emma           | 8905        | 164120
| Persuasion     | 6190        |  86755
|MansfieldPark   | 9376        | 163560

| James Joyce    |  New Words  | Total Words
|----------------|-------------|------------
|  Ulysses       | 30921       | 268238
| Portraint...   | 9901        |  88061
| Dubliners      | 8902        | 71053
